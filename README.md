# Refactor the e-commerce store in Svelte.js

# Peoject Overview
The aim of this project is to re-build the e-commerce store using Svelte.js, utilizing the built e-commerce store in react.js.

The project was built using the svelte template using vite thus to run the project you will first need to install the node modules running npm install. Then you can run the code using npm run dev.

# Tech Stack 
* HTML
* CSS Tailwind
* JavaScript
* Svelte.js

# Content
* Home Page
* Filter and Sort buttons
* Product List with cards of individual products
* A page that displays product details.

# Usage 
The website is an e-commerce store which users can browse for different products from different categories.

* The home page which displays the product list displays all the products in cards in default sorting.
* The website contains a filter dropdown and the sort options.
* When the filter option for a category is selected a new api call is made to get new data for products of that specific category.
* The user can than sort the data based on price from low to high and high to low.
* The user can then see more details about the product by clicking a product card to go to another page which will display the product details.

# Area of mastery
Working with Svelte.js, the different ways to handle data compared to React.js and Alpine.js, how to structure components in Svelte as it differs from React.js using script tags, style tags and straight html although I decided to use tailwind which rendered style tags unnecessary. The usage of writable for state management, the usage of two-way data binding, event listeners which are inline using on: and adding the event next to it. Then there was Routing which for my svelte project I used svelte-spa-router which works slighlty similar to react-routers.

# Project Process

# Challenges
The biggest challenge I had with this project was working it params which took me a long time to work around, luckily with the help of some of the lms content I kept referring back to it solve with some breaking and rebuilding. I also had a tough time refactoring the store from React to Svelte, which took me a lot longer to fix and have functional than I thought.

# Feedback
This was a great introduction to another different JavaScript framework different from React.js and Alpine.js . The project was diverse but thanks to the reference project and the knowledge of React.js and JavaScript, this was fun to work on. I found alot of familiarity between Svelte and React, more specifically the usage of routes and how we use components. The issue I didn't like was the small issues I would face, such as have the word image in alternatives on an img tag and it would complain about that.
